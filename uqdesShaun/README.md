Code taken from the [Bayesian differential equation solver](https://github.com/ochkrebtii/uqdes) as used in [Chkrebtii et al. (2016)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1473276259), modified here so it can use GPU's and/or sparse arrays. Also includes code and some results for benchmark comparisons of those options.
