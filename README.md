# probabilistic_numerics
Code and documentation for the various probabilistic numerics projects in Shaun's Ph.D. work. Each of the following subfolders has its own README with further details.

1) Laplace_Approximation: development of a tool to diagnose the quality of a Laplace Approximation based on Bayesian Quadrature.
2) uqdesShaun: modifications of Oksana's [Bayesian differential equation code](https://github.com/ochkrebtii/uqdes) (Chkrebtii et al. 2016) to allow it to use GPU's and/or sparse matrices.
