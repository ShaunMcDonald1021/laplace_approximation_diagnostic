Code and documentation for the Laplace Approximation Diagnostic project. Code is broken into the following subfolders:

1) JSM_experiment_code: code associated with the experiments I was doing in 2018, most of which ended up in my JSM poster presentation that year. Mainly looking at optimal point placements for 1-D three-point diagnostics, as well as some prelminary GPU benchmarking.
2) Laplace_diagnostic_POC: new (as of 2020) code and apps for a more practical look at the behaviour of the diagnostic.
3) accessory_code: helper functions, mainly for use with the "main" functions of Laplace_diagnostic_POC.
